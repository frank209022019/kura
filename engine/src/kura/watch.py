"""Keeping the library current while Kura is open.

- At start, a scan catches up on what changed while Kura was closed (once setup is done).
- The library folders are watched: when a video is added, removed or renamed, a scan starts once
  the folder has been quiet for a few seconds (a season still copying waits until it's done),
  looked for every second while a change waits.
- Episode lists are asked for again on schedule: every hour for shows still airing, every week
  for finished ones (kura/identify.py decides when one is due), and the gap reports follow.
- The rest of each franchise is looked up on AniList a few entries at a time, and each entry
  asked about again weekly, or daily while it airs (kura/franchises.py).

Nothing here runs while a scan does, and a scan the owner paused stays paused.
