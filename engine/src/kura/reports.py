"""The reports Kura writes next to each anime: "Kura - Gap analysis.md", worded by
kura/core/report.py. Plex ignores .md files.

A report only goes into a folder of the title's own: never a library folder itself, and never a
folder that holds another anime's videos (a mixed Downloads folder gets none; once tidied, each
show has its folder and its report). A report whose news hasn't changed isn't rewritten.
