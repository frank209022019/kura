"""Identifying the library: which anime, and which episode, every video is.

The scan's third stage. Files are grouped and looked up on AniList; with the owner's TMDB key the
same show or film is found on TMDB, whose episode lists say where each file sits and what's
missing. What AniList's search can't find by a file's name, TMDB's is asked for too, and AniList
for the names TMDB gives what it finds. A series' special its show's list doesn't name the way
the file does is looked up by its own name, as an OVA or special of its own. kura/core/identify.py
and kura/core/placing.py decide, this module asks the services and keeps the answers. A file Kura
isn't sure about waits for the owner, and files the owner placed by hand (pinned) are never
identified again.
