"""Where a file sits in a TMDB show: which season and episode, numbered the way Plex shows them.

Releases number episodes in three ways, and all of them land in TMDB's seasons:

- by season: "S02E05", or "05" in a "Season 02" folder;
- straight through: "Dragon Ball Z - 150" is the 150th episode, wherever TMDB's seasons break;
- per AniList entry: "Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2 - 03" is the third episode of a part that
  TMDB folds into its season 3, found by the part's first air date.

Specials and OVAs go to season 0 by the date they first aired, or by their own name ("Dragon Ball
Z - Special 06 - The History of Trunks"). Anything Kura can't place surely is left for the owner to
review.
