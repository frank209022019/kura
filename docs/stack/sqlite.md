# SQLite (Kura's database)

Everything Kura knows lives in one [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) file, `kura.db`, in the data folder.
There is no database server: Python's built-in `sqlite3` module opens the file directly. One file is
easy to back up, export, move to another drive, and open with any SQLite tool.

## Files

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `kura/db.py` | `connect()`, `migrate()`, `schema_version()` |
| `kura/migrations.py` | The schema, as an append-only list of SQL scripts |
| `kura/export.py` | The export zip, which includes a consistent copy of the database |

## Connecting

`db.connect(path)` opens the database the way Kura always uses it:

- `journal_mode = WAL`: readers keep working while a write happens, and a crash can't corrupt the
  file.
- `foreign_keys = ON`: relationships are enforced.
- `busy_timeout = 5000`: a writer waits up to five seconds for another instead of failing.
- Rows come back as `sqlite3.Row` (by name: `row["key"]`).

The API opens one connection per request (the `Database` dependency) and closes it afterwards.
Connections may move between threads but are never shared by two at once.

Write in transactions: `with conn: conn.execute(...)` commits on success and rolls back on error.
Always pass values as parameters (`?`), never with f-strings.

## Migrations

The schema version is SQLite's `PRAGMA user_version`. `migrations.py` holds `MIGRATIONS`, a tuple of
SQL scripts: script 1 takes a new database to version 1, script 2 to version 2, and so on.
`migrate()` runs the missing ones in order, each inside its own transaction, so a failure leaves the
database exactly as it was. A database newer than the running Kura is refused with a clear message
rather than touched.

To change the schema, append a script; never edit one that has shipped in a release. Use `STRICT`
tables, give every table a primary key, and add the new data to the export.

## The tables

| Table | Since | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settings` | 1 | Kura's preferences: one JSON value per key |
| `plans` | 2, 6 | Plans of changes: a title, when each was made, applied and undone, and since 6 its kind (`tidy`, which deleting uses too, or `convert`) |
| `changes` | 2 | The undo journal: each plan's moves and quarantines in order, with their state (`planned`, `moving`, `done`, `failed`, `undoing`, `undone`), any problem, and the folders each one created; since 8, when what one set aside was cleared out of quarantine |
| `folders` | 3 | The library folders, unique whatever their case |
| `files` | 3, 4, 13 | Every video a scan found: its folder, path, size and time (to notice changes), when it was found, last seen and gone, and once read, ffprobe's JSON report with the duration, size and codec at a glance, or why it couldn't be read. Since 4, what it is: its title, the AniList entry it matched, its season and episode as TMDB numbers them, how sure Kura is (`sure`, `unsure`, `none`, `extra`, `ignored`) with the best guesses for review, and whether the owner pinned it. Since 13, when the owner marked it broken (a scan leaves it so till it changes) |
| `scans` | 3, 4 | Each scan: when it started and finished, its state (`running`, `paused`, `done`, `failed`), its stage (`finding`, `reading`, `identifying`, `checking`, `done`), any problem, and a note on what it couldn't do though it finished |
| `titles` | 4 | Each anime and film in the library: its kind (`series`, `movie`, `ova`, `special`), name, year and release date (lists sort by it), its TMDB show or film and the AniList entry it was found by, whether it's airing, its poster (since 10, its wide background picture too), and when its episode list was last asked for |
| `episodes` | 4 | Each title's episode list, from TMDB (or AniList's count without a key): season (0 for the specials), number, name, air date and length |
| `anilist_links` | 5 | How AniList relates each entry the library matched to others (`SEQUEL`, `PREQUEL`, `PARENT`, `SIDE_STORY`, `ALTERNATIVE`, ...): what ties a franchise together |
| `jobs` | 6, 7, 11, 12 | The conversion queue: each file waiting, converting or converted, in the owner's order, its state (`queued`, `running`, `replacing`, `done`, `failed`, `skipped`, `restored`), the plan that put its result in place, and what it takes to put the original back; since 7, what the result was; since 11, when Kura next tries to put a result in place that waits beside an original another app has open; since 12, what ffmpeg said when it failed |
| `artwork_files` | 10 | The poster and background pictures Kura wrote next to a title, with their size: only these, unchanged, are Kura's to take away |

Migration 9 changed no table: it reworded what earlier tidy-ups said (the UI never names a media
server).

## Backups and export

- Consistent copies use SQLite's backup API (`source.backup(copy)`), never a file copy of a database
  in use. The export does this, and so do the nightly backups (`backups/kura 2026-10-11 0300.db`,
  the last 7 kept), each checked with `PRAGMA integrity_check` before it's kept. Backups made by
  hand, before a restore and from an export are named so (`kura 2026-10-11 1015 by hand.db`) and
  kept 7 of each kind; two made in one minute are `(2)` apart, and none is renamed over another.
- Restoring a backup opens it read-only (`file:…?mode=ro`, so one that went is never made anew,
  empty), checks it, backs up the live records (kept even when they don't check out: they're what
  there was, and the backup being restored is never pruned), then copies it into `kura.db` the
  same way, as the engine starts and before anything else opens the database, and migrates it if
  an older Kura made it.
- As the engine starts, `kura/rescue.py` checks the records (`PRAGMA quick_check`): damaged ones
  (SQLite's `SQLITE_CORRUPT` or `SQLITE_NOTADB`, a disk that can't read them,
  `SQLITE_IOERR_READ` or `_SHORT_READ`, or a check that doesn't come back `ok`) can't be backed up
  with the backup API, so restoring over them renames them aside instead, `-wal` first, so a new
  `kura.db` never meets an old write-ahead log. For a read error the app offers Try again first
  (the drive may have been away a moment). Another program holding the file isn't damage
  (`SQLITE_BUSY`): the engine fails to start, saying why.
- The exported `kura.db` is switched to `journal_mode = DELETE`, so it is one self-contained file.

## Looking inside

```powershell
cd engine; uv run python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.connect('.dev-data/kura.db').execute('select * from settings').fetchall())"
```

Or open `kura.db` in any SQLite browser while Kura isn't writing.
