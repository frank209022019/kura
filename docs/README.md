# Kura docs

Short pages, one subject each. Start with the architecture, then the page for what you're touching.
Coding agents start at [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); each area (`engine/`, `app/`, `app/src-tauri/`,
`docs/`) has its own `AGENTS.md` with the direction for working there.

| Page | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | The three parts (shell, UI, engine), how they talk, where data lives |
| [development.md](development.md) | Setting up this PC, running Kura, checks, updating dependencies |
| [conventions.md](conventions.md) | How we write code: Python, TypeScript, Rust, tests, commits |
| [design.md](design.md) | UI and UX rules, the Cinema language and its tokens, patterns |
| [releasing.md](releasing.md) | Versions, the installer, updates, third-party notices, the signing key |
| [design/](design/) | Every screen from the design canvas, as pages you can open |
| [readme/](readme/) | The README's pictures: Kura's own screens, with made-up titles |

## The stack
