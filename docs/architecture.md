# Architecture

Kura is three programs that work as one: a thin **shell** that owns the window, a **UI** inside it,
and an **engine** that does the real work. Everything runs on this PC; the only network traffic is
looking up titles and artwork (later) and checking for updates.

    ui -- "HTTP on 127.0.0.1 + token" --> engine
    engine --> data
    engine -- "reads; changes only after review" --> anime
    shell -- "latest.json, signed installer" --> releases
```

| Part | Where | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell | `app/src-tauri` | The window and its title bar, one instance at a time, the engine's lifetime, updates |
| UI | `app/src` | Every screen. Reads and changes things only through the engine's API |
| Engine | `engine/src/kura` | Scanning, identifying, planning, converting, reports, export, the database |

The shell stays small on purpose: logic that isn't about the window or the process belongs in the
engine, where it is easy to test.

## Start, run, stop

1. The shell starts `kura serve --watch-stdin` with a fresh random token in `KURA_TOKEN`
   (in development: `uv run kura …` from `engine/`; installed: the bundled `kura-engine.exe`).
2. The engine listens on `127.0.0.1` on a free port and prints one line:
   `{"event": "ready", "port": 51234}`. Before that, while a long job keeps it starting (moving
   the data to another drive), it prints `{"event": "working"}` every 5 seconds, and the shell
   waits on.
3. The shell sends the UI an `engine-status` event with the address and token.
4. The UI calls the API with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
5. On exit the shell closes the engine's stdin and the engine shuts down (the shell ends it
   after 3 seconds if it hasn't). If Kura crashes, Windows closes the pipe anyway, so the engine
   never outlives the window. The engine puts itself in a Windows job that ends every program it
   starts (ffmpeg) when it ends, however it ends.
6. With "Start with Windows" on (Settings > General), Windows starts Kura at sign-in in the tray.
   With "Keep Kura running when you close the window" on (beside it), closing the window keeps
   Kura there, so the queue, the nightly backup and the watching carry on; Quit Kura in the tray's
   menu ends it. Off, closing the window quits Kura. After the ready line the engine may print
   `{"event": "notify", "title": …, "body": …, "link": …}` lines (a finished batch, a queue that
   paused itself), which the shell shows as Windows notifications while the window is away, and
   passes to the window while it's open (the `notice` event), where they show as a note at its
   foot with View leading to `link` (the title's page, History, the queue).

If the engine is silent for a minute before its ready line, exits first, or stops on its own later,
the status becomes `failed` with the engine's last error lines, and the UI says so with "Try again"
and "Copy details". While the window is away (Kura waiting in the tray), a Windows notification
says so once, with the engine's own last sentence when it has one ("Kura's data is in F:\Kura,
which isn't there…"), and the shell tries again by itself after 30 seconds, a minute, 5 minutes,
then every 15 (an engine that ends soon after its ready line, one that couldn't start after all,
counts as failing again, not as a new run). Both sides of this handshake are tested:
`engine/tests/test_cli.py` and `app/src-tauri/src/engine.rs`.

## Contracts

| Between | How | Kept honest by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shell and engine | `serve` arguments, `KURA_TOKEN`, the ready line, stdin | Tests on both sides |
| Shell and UI | Commands `engine_status`, `restart_engine`, `prepare_update`, `install_update`; event `engine-status` | Types mirrored in `app/src/lib/engine.tsx` and `updates.ts` |
| UI and engine | JSON over HTTP, camelCase | `engine/openapi.json` snapshot + test; types in `app/src/lib/engine.tsx` |

The core is the heart and stays pure: it takes plain values (file facts, titles, settings) and
returns plain values (matches, plans, estimates). The code around it reads files, calls services
and writes the database, then hands the core what it needs. That way every rule about anime is a
fast, simple test.

The pipeline the core will grow into, step by step:

| Step | Takes | Gives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parse | file names and folders | title, season, episode, group, quality |
| Match | parsed names, AniList and TMDB | which anime and episode, with a confidence |
| Plan | matches, the standard, the naming style | proposed renames, moves, quarantines, conversions |
| Check | the library, finished conversions | gaps, broken files, verified outputs |
| Estimate | a plan, measured speeds | GPU time and disk space |

Scanning (`kura/scan.py`) runs on a background thread: it walks each library folder for videos
(`kura/library.py`, by the rules in `kura/core/library.py`) and records each with its size and
time, then reads the new and changed ones with ffprobe (`kura/probe.py`). Everything is saved as it
goes and the scan's stage is in the `scans` table, so a pause, an exit or a crash loses nothing: the
next start carries on. Then each video read is identified (`kura/identify.py`): files that look
like the same anime are looked up together on AniList (a release's numbered film by its own name,
asked again in shorter forms while nothing found is sure, and a name AniList writes otherwise as
it writes it; see [stack/anilist.md](stack/anilist.md)), and with the owner's TMDB key the same
show or film is found on TMDB, whose episode lists say where each file sits. An OVA or special
goes into its show's season 0 when the library has the show and TMDB lists it among the show's
specials on the day it first aired, or by its own name ("Special 06 - The History of Trunks");
otherwise it's a title of its own. Titles AniList ties
together by story (sequels, prequels, alternative versions, films, side stories) make a franchise
(`kura/core/franchise.py`): Home shows each franchise as one card with a page of its own (an entry
matched before Kura kept these links is asked about at the next scan). A file
Kura isn't sure about waits for the owner, whose choice is pinned (an episode Kura can't place
asks for its number), or who sets it aside as not anime, pinned too; the files set aside are
listed, and one taken back waits again, looked up afresh at the next scan (`Identifier.unignore`).
Offline, identification waits for the next scan and the scan says so. A
title's match can be changed for all its files at once (`Identifier.rematch`), chosen for its
first episode: files of that kind take the owner's choice, the others keep theirs (a series'
specials stay specials), and any that doesn't fit the new anime waits for the owner.
Last, the scan checks the library: each series with a folder of its own gets its
`Kura - Gap analysis.md` (`kura/reports.py`), rewritten only when its news changes. The missing
episodes are the ones TMDB lists as aired that no file holds (`kura/core/gaps.py`), or without a
TMDB key the ones AniList counts as aired so far; specials and OVAs are listed apart and never
counted as missing.

While Kura is open, `kura/watch.py` keeps the library current: a scan at start catches up on what
changed while Kura was closed; the library folders are watched (`watchdog`), so a new, removed or
renamed video starts a scan once its folder is quiet; and episode lists are asked for again on
schedule, hourly for shows still airing and weekly for finished ones.
A folder on an unplugged drive is skipped and its files stay as they were,
and so do the files in a folder the walk couldn't open; only a file whose folder is there without
it is marked gone. Links and junctions aren't followed. Files that couldn't be read are read again
by the next scan. If ffprobe itself doesn't work, the scan stops without marking any file and
ffmpeg is offered for download again. Scans only look; nothing in the folders changes.

Tidying up (`kura/tidy.py`) proposes where every identified video goes: Plex's layout under
its own library folder (`kura/core/plan.py` and `kura/core/naming.py`), each title's changes
together, with copies of one episode compared and all but the best set aside in a "Kura
quarantine" folder on the same drive. Copies are files of one title's same episode (a file
holding two episodes isn't a copy of one) or of one film; a film in parts (CD1, CD2) is filed as
its parts (`- pt1`, `- pt2`, as Plex stacks them). A video stays where it is, with the reason,
when its new name would be too long for Windows (its subtitles' included) or its new folder is
one scans skip (a link, or a name starting with a dot). A folder on the way that's there already
keeps its own spelling ("cowboy bebop (1998)"), so the records name files exactly as the disk
does. The owner keeps the titles they want, and
may keep the other copy instead.

A plan is applied only after review, exactly as reviewed: the app sends back each change it
showed (source, kind and target), and if Kura proposes any of them differently now (a scan or a
new match changed it), nothing moves and the owner looks again. `kura/changes.py` writes each
change to the database before and after its file moves, so it can be undone (newest first) and
so the engine, when it starts, can settle any move a crash interrupted. A plan counts as applied
from its first move, so History has it even after a crash, and the moves Kura hadn't reached
are closed at the next start (tidying up proposes them again). A change and its video's record
are saved together. Nothing is overwritten: a name another file has gets "(2)" in the plan, and
the review shows the two side by side ("Compare the two") or leaves that video out this time
("Skip"); a video left out keeps its subtitles with it, whatever was sent, and a name taken
after the review fails that change while the rest go ahead. A move to another drive copies,
checks the copy, and
only then removes the original. Subtitle files named after a video (`Episode 1.en.srt`) move and
rename with it (and stay with one that couldn't move: another app had it open, say), and folders
inside a library folder that the moves leave truly empty are removed
(undo makes them again as it moves the files back). A video's record moves with it, so it keeps
what it was identified as (a quarantined one counts as gone until it's put back); a gap analysis
left in a folder that no longer holds a video goes with the folder, and the reports are written
again where the shows are. Nothing moves while a scan runs, and no scan starts while files move
(`Scanner.hold`); what Windows tells of Kura's own moves starts no scan, since the records
follow them already. History lists every tidy-up,
which can be undone from there, and undone again for any file that couldn't go back the first
time (the plan counts as undone only once nothing is left).

Deleting (`tidy.delete`, from a title's page: the whole title, a season or one video; and from
"Which anime is this?": a file waiting for a match) is a plan of the same kind: each video and the subtitles named after it go to the quarantine on their own
drive (subtitles another copy of the video shares stay with it), folders left empty go, a video
waiting to be converted leaves the queue once it's gone (one converting can't be deleted), the
page says what stayed and why, and History, or the page right after, puts them back until the
quarantine is cleared out. Kura never deletes a file outright. Whatever its records say (a damaged
database, or one an imported export held), Kura deletes only a file in a day's folder of a
quarantine (`core.plan.in_quarantine`), its own unfinished results (`.kura-converting`,
`.kura-partial`) and its own `poster.jpg` and `fanart.jpg`; and, finishing a move to another
drive that a stop cut short, the original once the same file is in place (`changes._settle`).

Converting (`kura/convert.py`) brings one file to the standard by the method its recipe names
(`kura/core/convert.py`): the AI model between two ffmpegs (`kura/upscale.py`), or one ffmpeg
command (see [stack/upscaling.md](stack/upscaling.md)). The result is made beside the original,
checked (length, streams, Kura's tag, a test play at three points), and only then takes the
original's place, journaled like a tidy-up, the original going to quarantine; no scan runs
meanwhile. When the owner chose to delete originals, that one is cleared out of quarantine right
after (`quarantine.clear_original`), and the queue reckons each drive's room so: a result wants its
room only while it's made, and keeps what it adds over its original. What a file needs is decided
against the standard as it is now, so a changed standard offers again what Kura converted to the old
one. The queue (`kura/queue.py`) holds the files waiting, in the owner's order, and its worker
converts them one at a time while Kura is open; on the nights-only schedule it starts files only
between 23:00 and 07:00, or till 03:00 on a night the owner says to stop then (the queue page's
overnight note, `Queue.stop_early`), so Windows' sleep comes back sooner. Pausing or skipping stops
ffmpeg at once and leaves the original as it was (a paused file starts over); a result made already
is still checked and put in place when the queue pauses, and thrown away when it's skipped. A file
whose result would take a name that's taken fails before anything is made, and Windows doesn't sleep
while a file converts. A file saved over while it converted is left as it is now, and its result
goes. When another app has the original open as its result is ready (a player playing it:
`system.in_use` asks Windows for the right to move it), the checked result waits beside it and the
next file goes; a second thread of the queue puts it in place once the app lets go, trying every 5
minutes, or at once on "Try now", though another file is converting (`Queue.try_waiting`,
`convert.put_in`). Skipping it throws the result away (one a scan later finds that no job wants, its
drive away when it was skipped, say, goes then: `kura/leftovers.py`; a result is named after its
whole original, `Ep01.avi.kura-converting`, so an `Ep01.mp4` beside it has its own). After a crash,
a file that was converting waits in line again, and one whose result was taking its original's place
is finished, or its original put back. A clean stop leaves none of these, so finding any (or a
tidy-up's moves in flight) is how Kura knows it closed unexpectedly: `kura/recovery.py` keeps what
was settled, and Home says so in a sentence, until the owner looks (History has each file), for a
day. A stop the app asked for isn't told of, even one the app cut short (the engine notes
`stopping.txt` as it starts stopping), and nor is a start that restored a backup. A file being
converted (its result waiting beside it too), and any copy of it, stays out of tidy-ups and deletes.
History lists each conversion with what it made, and puts the original back on asking. Before
queueing, the Convert screen shows one frame of a file before and after (`kura/preview.py`), made
the way the conversion would make it, and kept as PNG in the cache.

A drive without room for a result (its estimated size with a margin, `convert.room_for`, free
space measured at the file's own folder, which may be another volume mounted there) pauses the
queue, which says what the files waiting there want and what's free (`queue.Room`); the Convert
screen works out the same before queueing a choice. A file that turns out, as converting starts,
to want more than the queue reckoned (a picture found interlaced is made anew) is remembered as
wanting that much. The owner can empty that drive's quarantine first (`quarantine.empty`:
everything set aside there goes for good, so the app asks once more), or convert what fits
(`Queue.convert_what_fits`): the files there that fit convert in turn and the rest wait for room
while the others go, starting by themselves once there is, till none waits there (then a full
drive pauses the queue again, to ask).

## Data

- **The data folder**, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kura`: `kura.db` (everything Kura knows), `logs/`
  (`engine.log`, kept 30 days), `tools/` (ffmpeg), `credentials.json` (the TMDB key, encrypted by
  Windows for this user and never exported), `cache/` (answers from TMDB and AniList, safe to
  delete), `artwork/` (posters), `backups/` (the last 7 nights, each checked as it's made, and
  apart from them the last 7 made by hand, before a restore and from an export; none is ever
  written over). `kura/care.py` makes tonight's backup from 03:00 (or the first chance after) and
  clears out of the quarantine, once a day, what has waited longer than the owner keeps it. A
  backup chosen in Settings is restored as the engine starts again, before anything opens the
  database, once it checks out; what Kura knew till then is backed up first, and kept even when
  it doesn't check out.
  Development uses `engine/.dev-data`, so it never touches the real folder.
- **Moving it** to another drive (Settings > Your data, `kura/relocate.py`): the owner picks a
  folder (an empty or new one on a drive of this PC's own, not a network share, where SQLite's
  write-ahead log isn't safe; outside the data folder, with room); the app starts the engine
  again, and as it starts, before it logs or opens anything, the engine copies the data there,
  checks the copy (sizes and the database), and only then removes the old one. The home folder
  keeps a note, `location.txt` (UTF-16, so the uninstaller reads any path's letters), naming
  where the data went: Kura, `kura export` and the
  uninstaller follow it, and an engine whose moved data isn't there (an unplugged drive) says so
  instead of starting empty. A move that fails leaves everything where it was, and Settings says
  why. While the data moves, the home keeps `moving.json` (where from, where to), so a move cut
  short (a power cut, the app ended) is settled at the next start: finished when the data had
  switched to its new place, or else the part-made copy goes and Settings says so.
- **The database** is SQLite, upgraded in place by migrations (see [stack/sqlite.md](stack/sqlite.md)).
  A database written by a newer Kura is refused, not damaged. Records damaged past use (a disk
  fault, a power cut mid-write: `kura/rescue.py`) are found as the engine starts, before anything
  else opens them; the engine then answers only `/records` and `/health`, tells the app (a
  notification, while Kura waits in the tray), and the app's window shows the way back in place
  of every page: the newest backup that opens, restored over them, or, with none, new records as
  on Kura's first day (when the disk couldn't read them, Try again comes first). Either way the
  damaged file is set aside as it is, never deleted (`kura (damaged 2026-10-12 0930).db`, with its
  `-wal`, beside where it was), and the app starts the engine again.
- **With the anime**: `Kura - Gap analysis.md` per anime (the owner can turn these off in
  Settings, which takes them out of the folders), later `Kura - History.md`, a tag inside each
  converted MKV, and, when the owner turns them on, `poster.jpg` and `fanart.jpg` in each show's
  and film's own folder for media servers (`kura/artwork_files.py`, written by Kura's care from
  TMDB's or AniList's larger pictures; never over a file that's there, and only Kura's own,
  unchanged, taken away again, or made way for once the videos are matched to another title; a
  show whose drive isn't connected waits, and a picture the server refuses is asked for again
  only a day later). These survive a reinstall, and Kura can rebuild its
  library from the tags.
- **Export**: one zip, readable without Kura, written to a folder the owner picks in Settings (or
  with `kura export`). It grows with the schema. Settings imports one too, from this PC or
  another: the database it holds is restored like a backup as the engine starts again (kept
  beside the backups as one "from an export"), and what Kura knew till then is backed up first.
  An export from a newer Kura waits for an update.
- **Quarantine**: `Kura quarantine\<day>\` on each drive the library is on, holding copies set
  aside and converted files' originals; Settings shows its size and how long it's kept.

## Safety on a shared PC

- The engine listens only on `127.0.0.1`, on a port chosen at random.
- Every request needs the launch's token; anything else gets 401.
- Only the app's own pages may call it (CORS), and only when addressed to this PC (Host check).
- The window's content security policy allows the app itself, Tauri's IPC and the local engine.
- The window may call only the core APIs, its title bar buttons and Kura's own commands
  (`app/src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`).
- An update runs only if its signature matches the public key built into Kura.
